# Gleaming the grid

> When eating an elephant take one bite at a time. --Creighton Abrams

With griddly, grid explorers like you work together to map every inch of the electricity distribution grid. This is a huge task. 

> When mapping the grid look at one pole at a time.

## Find a place to map

## Find a pole

The best place to start a collection session is to find a pole that is connected to a mapped pole - that way your new observations will be a direct extension of the already-mapped territory. But don't worry if that's not possible - much better to just start making observations, even if it will be an island for now.

## Add a pole

First we'll take note of a pole's "vitals". Switch to the `Pole` tab if needed, and note whether the new pole symbol (⬇️) is in the right spot.

1. Use the map to adjust the position of the new pole cursor as needed
2. Enter the pole's ID tag number, if the utility uses them.
3. Note whether the pole has a streetlight and/or a riser connecting its wires to an underground conduit.
4. Save the pole

## Identify the high and low voltage connections.

Each pole can host zero, one, or more separate sets of primary / high voltage and secondary / low-voltage lines. Use the buttons at the bottom of the `Pole` tab to add the appropriate number of each.

## Add transformer(s), if any

Pole-top transformers are very obvious, but in some cases it can be a bit tricky to determine their size and how they are connected.

1. Enter whether the transformer is single-phase (by far the most common in the US), or three-phase.
2. Enter the transformer's size rating in KVA. This is sometimes stenciled in large numbers on the side of the cylinder, and other times must be guessed from the size. If the size is guessed, be sure to check the `Size Unsure` box.
3. In the US, three-phase transformers are usually created by grouping three single-phase transformers of the same size. If this is the case, enter all three transformers as described here, and additionally check the `Grouped` box for each.

## Add High Voltage / Primary Lines
