## Poles are organized from top to bottom

Most poles carry more than one kind of wire, possibly including high voltage electricity, low-voltage electricity, cable television, conventional phone lines, and others. Some poles also carry wireless communication equipment, such as mobile phone antennae.

The most dangerous stuff is at the top, least dangerous at the bottom. The one exception, apparently, is that sometimes wireless communication antennae are at the top, above even the HV lines.

## HV lines go the distance, LV lines finish the job

Electricity is conducted more efficiently at high voltages. The 120/240V predominantly used in American homes and businesses can only be transmitted a very short distance without incurring substantial losses. That means that HV lines must extend almost to the meter, with a step-down transformer within a few hundred feet of every single service point.

If a pole has high voltage lines, and many of them do, they will be the uppermost ones. A pole may have more than one set of high voltage lines, and they will all be
